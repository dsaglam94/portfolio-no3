      "The reason I started learning software development is that I wanted to contribute online teaching with an easy to use website for playing games with students. For this reason, I built a website where students can play board games and answer or talk about funny questions. But the problem was that there wasn't any good API to fetch these questions. I needed to make everything more robost so I built this API. It uses MongoDB's database to keep the data, teachers can vote questions to help sorting out better ones.",

It was challenging enough to take me a couple of days to figure out how to implement the things the way that I wanted them to be. However, this led to a great experience of my software development journey. It showed me that I could build such web sites without a help, from scratch. I implemented what I learned and also learned more during the built process by searching and reading.",
